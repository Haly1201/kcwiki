Everyone is Valuable All members and their knights are valuable and essential to this event. No one is too weak to contribute\u2014 everyone plays an important role . 2. Coordinates & Communication Coordinates and communication are essential to success. Use the flags on the map to know when to attack , defend , or avoid occupying certain locations. 3. Points and Buildings On the chessboard , you earn points by occupying various buildings: - Cities (from day 1) - Villages (from day 1) - Castles and the Royal Palace (from day 3) Each building has a different point value and allows you to deploy a different number of knights . In addition, the ruins (available from day 2) do not give points, but improve knights \u2014, making them indispensable for fighting tougher enemies. Your knights have two mobilities , which are renewed twice for free during the day. Mobility can also be restored by purchasing red flags with gold. 4. Choosing knights for different tasks Depending on the enemy alliances and the areas you are moving in, choose your knights wisely: - Strong knights to attack enemy buildings or strong alliances. - Medium knights for weaker alliances or points that should not be left open. - Weak knights for non-threatening routes or to control enemy power in a square. Tip : When building routes , it is safe to send one knight if the route is not dangerous. But when surrounding an enemy alliance, it is better to have three knights in one tile for added security. 5. Defend your base Your base is the starting point, and if it is attacked, you risk losing all connections to previously occupied areas. Why is this important? - When your base is offline, your knights are weakened and useless . - You can\u2019t move them without wasting their mobility. - It\u2019s best to reestablish connections as soon as possible to avoid these problems. Tip : When you break another alliance\u2019s connection, don\u2019t attack the disconnected/weakened knights . Let them recall their knights, wasting their mobility and conserving damage. If you kill them, they will conserve their mobility and heal themselves. 6. Avoid losing knights to powerful enemies If you encounter powerful enemy knights , don't waste all your knights trying to defeat them. Instead, try to move around the area or wait for a stronger ally to help you. It's not worth losing all your knights for a single square in a war! The first few times chess will be held inter server, this means this will be part of rotation. Later the event will become Cross Server, then it will never be inter server again. \u26d4\ufe0f NEVER attack alliances from our own server","title":"Chess"},{"location":"chess/#chessboard-strategy-tips","text":"","title":"\u2694\ufe0f Chessboard Strategy &amp; Tips"},{"location":"chess/#1-everyone-is-valuable","text":"All members and their knights are valuable and essential to this event.

Lords travel through the pages, fighting criminals before facing a big boss to either move on to the next case or repeat the current case. \ud83d\udca5 PART A: Murder Mystery Revisited : What's new: Phantom Assault (Player vs. Player): Guess who attacked you anonymously and counterattack. Better rewards from disappearing chests (1pt and 2pt hearts, random talent scrolls). Surprise attacks from criminals unless you attack them first. Key-holding criminals block your escape until they are defeated. More buffs with hearts playing a bigger role. Increased availability of dossier pieces. \ud83d\udd0d Choose a strategy : You have two main strategies: 1. Repeat a deal without advancing. 2. Advance in deals , then repeat a higher level. \u267b\ufe0f Repeat a case : Focus only on collecting keys to earn points. The basic strategy is to: 1. Collect keys (optional: chests or case files). 2. Enter the door to earn points and repeat the case. 3. Get defeated by the crime boss to restart the case. Note : This strategy is for those who do not plan on progressing. However, progressing increases the points per case and adds more fun! \u2694\ufe0f Business Progression : When progressing through the business, the goal is to become strong enough to defeat the crime boss . - Collect the 3 buffs (attack, defense, and heart) and coins on each page. - Fight criminals to get coins. - Use coins to get buffs, items, and weapons in the shop . - Repeat the business as needed until you\u2019re ready to defeat the boss. \ud83d\udca5 Using Stamina: Best Practices : When a puzzle is solved on a tile, the adjacent tiles shrink by one. This indirectly shrinks the surrounding tiles, saving Stamina. Start with tiles with 1 puzzle touching 2 or more elements. Avoid tapping 2-puzzle tiles unless there are no 1-puzzle tiles . Tip : Focus on key tiles, but if you encounter disappearing chests or criminals attacking you , prioritize them. \ud83d\udca5 PART B: Vanishing Chests and Phantom Assault : \ud83d\udcb0 Vanishing Chests : Chests offer 1pt and 2pt hearts , random talent scrolls , and more. They cost 5 stamina and must be discovered in 8-9 hits . Chest Strategy : 1. Check if the tiles adjacent to the chest are touching other objects. 2. First eliminate individual tiles that are touching the chest and other objects. 3. Decide if you can afford to have enough stamina to discover the chest (3 or more stamina required may not be worth it). \ud83d\udc7b Ghostly Assault: Player vs. Player : As you progress, Black Masks will appear, marking the start of a Ghostly Assault . You can anonymously attack nearby players and earn up to 300 bonus points . Tap Nearby Lords to see 30 random lords near your ranking. Attacks can cause small damage (standard attack) or send players back to the start (item attack). Counterattack : You have a 1 in 4 chance to retaliate. Guess who attacked you and earn around 300 bonus points for a successful counterattack. \u2694\ufe0f Surprise Criminal Attacks : Some criminals will continuously attack unless you attack them first. You have 5 hits to clear their square and initiate the attack. After being hit, their timer resets and the attacks continue until they are eliminated. \ud83d\udcdc Easy Casework Solutions : Use the Fragment Compose Icon to recycle unwanted parts (4 extra for 1 needed). It is recommended to keep 1 extra set in reserve before recycling. Tip : Ask Alliance members to share their list of extra and missing parts. However, if your goal is to score ranking points, there is no point in wasting movement on Casework missions.","title":"Murder Mystery"},{"location":"mystery-murder/#murder-mystery","text":"Each case in Murder Mystery consists of 10 levels (pages) .
