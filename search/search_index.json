Points and Buildings","text":"<p>On the chessboard, you earn points by occupying various buildings: - Cities (from day 1) - Villages (from day 1) - Castles and the Royal Palace (from day 3)</p> <p>Each building has a different point value and allows you to deploy a different number of knights . In addition, the ruins (available from day 2) do not give points, but improve knights\u2014, making them indispensable for fighting tougher enemies. Your knights have two mobilities, which are renewed twice for free during the day. Mobility can also be restored by purchasing red flags with gold.</p>"},{"location":"chess/#4-choosing-knights-for-different-tasks","title":"4. Choosing knights for different tasks","text":"<p>Depending on the enemy alliances and the areas you are moving in, choose your knights wisely: - Strong knights to attack enemy buildings or strong alliances. - Medium knights for weaker alliances or points that should not be left open. - Weak knights for non-threatening routes or to control enemy power in a square. Tip: When building routes, it is safe to send one knight if the route is not dangerous. But when surrounding an enemy alliance, it is better to have three knights in one tile for added security.</p>"},{"location":"chess/#5-defend-your-base","title":"5. Defend your base","text":"<p>Your base is the starting point, and if it is attacked, you risk losing all connections to previously occupied areas. Why is this important? - When your base is offline, your knights are weakened and useless. - You can\u2019t move them without wasting their mobility. - It\u2019s best to reestablish connections as soon as possible to avoid these problems.</p> <p>Tip: When you break another alliance\u2019s connection, don\u2019t attack the disconnected/weakened knights. Let them recall their knights, wasting their mobility and conserving damage. If you kill them, they will conserve their mobility and heal themselves.</p>"},{"location":"chess/#6-avoid-losing-knights-to-powerful-enemies","title":"6. Avoid losing knights to powerful enemies","text":"<p>If you encounter powerful enemy knights, don't waste all your knights trying to defeat them. Instead, try to move around the area or wait for a stronger ally to help you. It's not worth losing all your knights for a single square in a war!
