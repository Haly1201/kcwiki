# 🌹 **Scarlet Beauty: Strategy and Tips**

### 1. 🎯 **One Shot, One Kill** 
To maximize your points, **check your total damage** and try to **kill enemies with a single hit**. Avoid wasting attacks on enemies that require multiple hits to kill.
  
- **Important**: You’ll earn **more points** by killing an enemy with a **single hit** than by hitting a stronger enemy twice.  
  
Here are the maximum points for each enemy level:
- **Level 1 Young Thug**: *Max points per attack: 200* 
- **Level 2 Old Thug**: *Max points per attack: 300* 
- **Level 3 Fierce Bandit**: *Max points per attack: 400* 
- **Level 4 Butcher**: *Max points per attack: 600* 
- **Level 5 Lord of Death**: *Max points per attack: 800* 
- **Level 6 Evil Witch**: *Max points per attack: 1200* 
- **Level 7 Messenger of Darkness**: *Max points per attack: 2000*  
**Example**: 
If you kill a **level 4 enemy** in one hit, you get **600 points**. If you kill a **level 5 enemy** in two hits, you get **800 points**, but you wasted an extra hit. Using that second hit on another level 4 enemy would net you **1,200 points** in total.

**💡 Tip**: If you can’t kill an enemy in one hit, go for **lower level enemies** that you can kill for guaranteed points!

### 2. 💰 **Increase your attack with gold** 
You can increase your attack with gold, but only if:
- You are **about to kill** the next enemy in range.
- You have the resources.
**Otherwise**, it's not worth it and won't make much difference against the **Scarlet Beauty**.

### 3. 🧠 **Check Intelligence before researching** 
Before spending stamina on research, check the **Intelligence** section to see if there are already enemies you can kill. Every time you **run away** from an enemy, they go into Intelligence mode, ready to be killed by another alliance member!

### 4. ⚔️ **Don't waste more than 4 hits on Scarlet Beauty** 
Hitting **Scarlet Beauty** more than **four times** becomes **unprofitable** due to diminishing returns and **wasting silver scabbards**.

### 5. 🏆 **Alliance Rewards** 
If an **alliance member kills Scarlet Beauty**, **all alliance members** receive the rewards (**4000 points**), even if they didn't hit her!
