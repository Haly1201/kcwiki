# ⛏️ **Royal Mine: Collect Ore and Battle for Points**

The **Royal Mine** event consists of **collecting iron ore** and **battling other players** during your explorations. To score points, it is important to collect as much **iron ore** as possible and participate in battles.

### 🏞️ **Exploration and movement**:
- **Each exploration** costs **1 exploration point**.
- **Moving to a new location** costs **1 exploration point**.
- In **fog**, movement costs **double**, so be careful as the fog spreads (it increases with each renewal).
**Tip**: If you are aiming for a high spot, hiding in a **foggy area** can help you avoid being found.

### 🔍 **What you can find**:
- **Iron Ores**: Collect ores to get points.
- **Emblem Chests**: They provide upgrades (indicated by the chest symbol).
- **Other Players**: Attacking other players earns you **2 Iron Ores for each defeated knight** (and deducts points from the player you attacked).

Each area has a limited amount of **resources**, but they are **renewed throughout the day**.

### 🚩 **Defensive Tactics**:
If you are **attacked 5 times** without completing the exploration, you will be moved to an **adjacent area**. 
You can find other players in the **intelligence section** of the alliance, where you can:
- **use decrees** to attack or take revenge.

- **use a protective decree** to protect an ally (especially useful for those aiming for the title).

### 🔨 **Scoring with iron ore**:
The best tactic is to start **mining iron ore** at the beginning of each renewal. Mines offer **larger quantities of ore** from the start. Regardless of your strength, focus on **scoring with iron ore**. Once an area runs out of ore (you can see the number of ores in the **top right corner**), move to a quieter area.

### ⚔️ **Encountering Enemies**:
When you encounter an enemy in the mine, you have two options:
1. **Avoid**.
2. **Fight**.

**Tip**: To decide whether to fight, check the player's power by tapping **Intelligence** at the bottom of the screen, then tap their **avatar** to see their stats. This will help you choose the right knight for the battle or decide whether to avoid them.
