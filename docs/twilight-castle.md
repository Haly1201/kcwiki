# 🏰 Twilight Castle: Exploration and Combat Event

**Twilight Castle** is an exploration-based event where you can choose which paths to take. During your exploration, you may encounter the following:

### 🛡️ **Enemies**:
Each enemy has different health points, and killing them will earn you points. You should consider the power of the knights you decide to use in combat. See the “Reward Overview” section for more information.

- **Scoundrel**: 250 (Damage) + 65 (Kill Rewards) = 285 points
- **Bewitched Villager**: 300 (Damage) + 75 (Kill Rewards) = 375 points
- **Dracula's Servant**: 400 (Damage) + 100 (Kill Rewards) = 500 points
- **Bewitched Lady**: 500 (Damage) + 125 (Kill Rewards) = 625 points

### 👑 **Boss**:
Bosses like **Sinful Knight** and **Greedy Helper** give higher points and random rewards, such as increased knight strength or an extra chance to use the same knight.

- **Sinful Knight**: 3.6K (Damage) + 350-4K (Kill Rewards - Random)
- **Greedy Helper**: 4.2K (Damage) + 350-4K (Kill Rewards - Random)

### 🦇 **Dracula**:
Killing Dracula earns you a lot of points and random rewards like bosses. Keep track of how many levels are left before Dracula spawns.

- **Dracula**: 7.5K (damage points) + 700-10K (kill rewards - random)

### 🌫️ **Mist**:
Mist allows you to **increase** or **decrease** the power of one of your knights.
- **Increase Damage**: Use the fixed amount on weaker knights and the **20% bonus** on stronger ones for boss fights.
- **Reduce Damage**: Apply it to weaker or unused knights.

### 💰 **Chests**:
There are 2 types of chests that can be opened with keys (found during the event or purchased). These provide points for ranking. A good tactic is to **accumulate chests** and open them at the end to quickly increase your ranking.

### 🔮 **Foresight or Curses**:
- **Foresight** allows you to see what awaits you on the path.
- **Curses** are sent to other players, blocking their view of the path.

### 🏛️ **Treasure Crypts**:
Treasure Crypts provide random coins used as points for the overall ranking. Always try to choose a path that earns you coins/points.

### ⚔️ **Using Knights**:
Knights can be used **6 times per day**. The first use is free, while subsequent uses require:
- **Jackpot Item** (random chance after killing bosses).
- **Expedition Orders** (purple items).

### 📈 **Increase Knight Power with Allies**:
In this event, your Knight’s Power can be increased if nearby Alliance members are of the same level. The more players present, the higher your Knights’ Attack Power. **Coordinate with your Alliance to play together** to increase base damage.

### 🛤️ **Skip Levels**:
You can skip levels once Treasure Crypts or Mists are no longer available. However, it’s generally best to develop your Knights by choosing strategic paths and playing alongside your Alliance for additional Power bonuses.
