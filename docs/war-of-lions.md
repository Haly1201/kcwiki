# 🦁 LION WAR

📯 **Supply Reserve Stage (Day 1)**

During this phase, you can explore (after selecting a strong knight) different locations where you can collect different materials that help strengthen the fortress (rock, grain, wood). Each exploration costs 1 stamina point, moving to a different area will cost 3 stamina points. [5 stamina points gained every 30 minutes].

In these locations, you can find three different types of chests, which give you useful resources and ranking points. You can also steal these chests from other players after attacking them, but first check which knights they are using to see if you can beat them.

**Available Chests:**
- Wooden Chests (60 seconds): 200 Event Points, 10 Resources.
- Silver Chests (120 seconds): 600 Event Points, 30 Resources.
- Golden Chests (180 seconds): 1,500 Event Points, 75 Resources.

__Since it is difficult to open the chests before they are stolen, we all move to the same location in order to discourage enemy presence in the same area.__

> The number of players in a specific area is indicated in the upper right corner.
> Our Camp: The players on our server.
> Population: The total number of players in that area.
> If the population is higher than the number indicated on "your camp", it means that there are enemy players in that location.

If you are alone with chests and someone starts attacking you to steal them, try to quickly change location (although it costs 3 stamina points). If you want to steal chests from someone, always check the power of the knight and if you are able to do it (otherwise you risk losing the chests you have at that moment). 

Chests are not infinite and renew every few hours and once they are exhausted it is better to look for a new area or wait for the next renewal (because they help you score points for the ranking!).

In these areas, in addition to chests and other players, you can meet NPCs, which you can fight and who will give you a small amount of resources and points. 

> Tip: Once you have opened chests and they are no longer present in an area, you wait for the next chest renewal. During this time, do not attack and leave weak or average knights somewhere. If someone attacks you and fails to defeat you, you gain points. Once your knight is dead, place a new knight and wait. This is a good tactic to score passive points while waiting for a renewal. 

At the end of this first phase, depending on the supplies given, the fortress obtains a certain number of stars (the stronger the fortress, the less damage it will take in the second phase).

**Donation**
During this stage, you can also donate resources (money, troops, or grain) so that the fortress gets an additional reduction in damage taken during the second stage. It is highly recommended to donate only a portion of your grain, as you need the other resources for other things. This donation does not earn you points for the individual ranking.

⚔️ **Fortress War Stage (Days 2-4)**

Once the first phase is over, the Fortress War begins.

Before the phase begins, you must choose 3 knights to put on the attack (left, sword symbol) and 3 to put on the defense (right, shield symbol). The game automatically selects them for you, but you can change them and it is best to do this: **on the attack, put your strongest knights, on the defense your weakest knights**. Remember to do this in the evening because once the event starts in the morning, you cannot change the knights for that day.

> During this phase, you must attack enemy forts and the knights you encounter there in order to destroy the enemy fortress. Fighting high-level knights is more profitable in terms of points you get for ranking (gold to diamond are the most profitable). Unfortunately, you won't always encounter strong knights during your explorations, but you can avoid them without losing stamina. If you encounter low-ranked knights and don't want to attack them, simply click back, click on another fortress and you will lose the result of your previous exploration. Then go back to the previous fortress and explore again!

Defending knights have a certain number of lives, so you can encounter them several times before they die for good (there is a number that tells you how many lives an enemy knight has left). Thus, exploration can be infinite, while endurance is the amount of attacks that can be made: each attack consumes one endurance point, one is recovered every 12 minutes, with a limit of 20 endurance points.

After defeating several knights, you might have the opportunity to use 1000 gold to hire a **Legion of Conquerors**, which will deal damage to enemy fortresses (dealing 80% of the combat power of your current offensive knights). Given the gold expenditure, use them logically and only when you have put your strongest knight on the attack.

**Mercenaries**
You can buy mercenaries and place them in defense of the fortress. They are very weak, but their purpose is to make the enemies lose stamina before the fortress falls and to gain very few points (they only bring 100k). Mercenaries will only appear once all the knights are defeated.

When the fortress falls, server points and individual points are lost, the percentage of points lost increases if the fortress falls a second and third time. That is why it is sometimes necessary to rebuild slowly if it is still early in the day.

To rebuild the fortress, one can contribute for free or even using mercenaries, but it is not always worth losing mercenaries to rebuild. On the contrary, it is possible to place them again in defense of the fortress (as is normally done when placing them at the beginning of the event).

> 📌 UPDATE - You can select skills to attack knights: use brown skills (wild counterattack) on the weakest knight, then red (favorable start) and purple (retreat to advance). Red if you have a very busy day, purple when you are more active. The other skills are useful for legions.
