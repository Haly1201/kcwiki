# ⚔️ **Chessboard Strategy & Tips**

### 1. **Everyone is Valuable**
All members and their knights are **valuable** and **essential** to this event. No one is too weak to contribute—**everyone plays an important role**.

### 2. **Coordinates & Communication**
**Coordinates** and **communication** are essential to success. Use the flags on the map to know when to **attack**, **defend**, or **avoid occupying** certain locations.

### 3. **Points and Buildings**
On the **chessboard**, you earn points by occupying various buildings:
- **Cities** (from day 1)
- **Villages** (from day 1)
- **Castles** and the **Royal Palace** (from day 3)

Each building has a different point value and allows you to deploy a **different number of knights** . In addition, the **ruins** (available from day 2) do not give points, but **improve knights**—, making them indispensable for fighting tougher enemies.  
Your knights have **two mobilities**, which are **renewed twice for free** during the day. Mobility can also be restored by purchasing **red flags** with gold.

### 4. **Choosing knights for different tasks**
Depending on the **enemy alliances** and the **areas** you are moving in, choose your knights wisely:
- **Strong knights** to attack enemy buildings or strong alliances.
- **Medium knights** for weaker alliances or points that should not be left open.
- **Weak knights** for non-threatening routes or to control enemy power in a square.
**Tip**: When **building routes**, it is safe to send **one knight** if the route is not dangerous. But when surrounding an enemy alliance, it is better to have **three knights** in one tile for added security.

### 5. **Defend your base**
Your **base** is the starting point, and if it is attacked, you risk losing **all connections** to previously occupied areas.
Why is this important?
- When your base is offline, your knights are **weakened** and **useless**.
- You can’t move them without wasting their mobility.
- It’s best to **reestablish connections** as soon as possible to avoid these problems.

**Tip**: When you break another alliance’s connection, **don’t attack the disconnected/weakened knights**. Let them recall their knights, wasting their mobility and conserving damage. If you kill them, they will conserve their mobility and heal themselves.
### 6. **Avoid losing knights to powerful enemies**
If you encounter **powerful enemy knights**, don't waste all your knights trying to defeat them. Instead, try to **move** around the area or **wait for a stronger ally** to help you. It's not worth losing all your knights for a single square in a war!
The first few times chess will be held inter server, this means this will be part of rotation. 
Later the event will become Cross Server, then it will never be inter server again. 
⛔️**NEVER attack alliances from our own server**
