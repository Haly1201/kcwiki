# 🕵️‍♂️ Murder Mystery 

Each case in **Murder Mystery** consists of **10 levels (pages)**. Lords travel through the pages, fighting criminals before facing a **big boss** to either move on to the next case or repeat the current case.

### 💥 **PART A: Murder Mystery Revisited**:
### What's new:
- **Phantom Assault** (Player vs. Player): Guess who attacked you anonymously and counterattack.
- **Better rewards** from disappearing chests (1pt and 2pt hearts, random talent scrolls).
- **Surprise attacks** from criminals unless you attack them first.
- **Key-holding criminals** block your escape until they are defeated.
- **More buffs** with hearts playing a bigger role.
- **Increased availability** of dossier pieces.

### 🔍 **Choose a strategy**:
You have two main strategies:
1. **Repeat a deal** without advancing.
2. **Advance in deals**, then repeat a higher level.

### ♻️ **Repeat a case**:
Focus only on **collecting keys** to earn points. The basic strategy is to:
1. Collect **keys** (optional: chests or case files).
2. Enter the door to earn points and repeat the case.
3. Get defeated by the crime boss to restart the case.

**Note**: This strategy is for those who do not plan on progressing. However, progressing increases the points per case and adds more fun!

### ⚔️ **Business Progression**:
When progressing through the business, the goal is to become strong enough to defeat the **crime boss**.
- Collect the **3 buffs** (attack, defense, and heart) and **coins** on each page.
- **Fight criminals** to get coins.
- Use coins to get buffs, items, and weapons in the **shop**.
- Repeat the business as needed until you’re ready to defeat the boss.

### 💥 **Using Stamina: Best Practices**:
- When a puzzle is solved on a tile, the adjacent tiles shrink by one. This indirectly shrinks the surrounding tiles, saving Stamina.
- Start with tiles with **1 puzzle** touching 2 or more elements.
- Avoid tapping **2-puzzle tiles** unless there are no **1-puzzle tiles**.

**Tip**: Focus on key tiles, but if you encounter **disappearing chests** or **criminals attacking you**, prioritize them.

### 💥 **PART B: Vanishing Chests and Phantom Assault**:

### 💰 **Vanishing Chests**:
- Chests offer **1pt and 2pt hearts**, **random talent scrolls**, and more.
- They cost **5 stamina** and must be discovered in **8-9 hits**.

**Chest Strategy**:
1. Check if the tiles adjacent to the chest are touching other objects.
2. First eliminate **individual tiles** that are touching the chest and other objects.
3. Decide if you can afford to have enough stamina to discover the chest (3 or more stamina required may not be worth it).

### 👻 **Ghostly Assault: Player vs. Player**:
As you progress, **Black Masks** will appear, marking the start of a **Ghostly Assault**. You can anonymously attack nearby players and earn up to **300 bonus points**.

- Tap **Nearby Lords** to see 30 random lords near your ranking.
- Attacks can cause small damage (standard attack) or send players back to the start (item attack).

**Counterattack**: You have a **1 in 4** chance to retaliate. Guess who attacked you and earn around **300 bonus points** for a successful counterattack.

### ⚔️ **Surprise Criminal Attacks**:
Some criminals will **continuously attack** unless you attack them first. You have **5 hits** to clear their square and initiate the attack. After being hit, their timer resets and the attacks continue until they are eliminated.

### 📜 **Easy Casework Solutions**:
Use the **Fragment Compose Icon** to recycle unwanted parts (4 extra for 1 needed). It is recommended to **keep 1 extra set** in reserve before recycling.

- **Tip**: Ask Alliance members to share their list of extra and missing parts. However, if your goal is to score ranking points, there is no point in wasting movement on Casework missions.
